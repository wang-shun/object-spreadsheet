# update-handsontable: Updates the Handsontable compiled files used by Object
# Spreadsheets.  Follow the "Installation" steps at the top of
# tests/handsontable/Gruntfile.js before running.
#
# Object Spreadsheets uses a modified version of Handsontable in the
# tests/handsontable submodule.  We use the Handsontable build system, which
# compiles the sources in tests/handsontable/src to the files in
# tests/handsontable/dist (which are checked in), and then copy the relevant
# files to public/handsontable (which we also check in).
#
# It's unfortunate to check in two copies of the generated files and require a
# manual step.  At least we rarely change Handsontable.  Alternatives
# considered:
# - Use a Meteor package with Npm.depends on a Handsontable package built from a
#   custom git repository.  This feature is designed to be used with URLs to
#   remote repositories and doesn't look like it supports local repositories, so
#   the development cycle to test changes to Handsontable would be terrible.
#   Also, we'd add the Handsontable build (about 20 seconds in Matt's testing,
#   possibly plus additional overhead) to the build time from a "meteor reset".
# - Write a Meteor build plugin to call the Handsontable build system.  This
#   would be very difficult to get right (the Meteor build plugin API certainly
#   isn't designed for it) and would have the same build-time cost.
# - Load the source files directly instead of compiling them.  This might be
#   workable.
# - Make symlinks from public/handsontable to the submodule.  Then Object
#   Spreadsheets won't run on Windows.  (Granted, this script needs a
#   bash-compatible shell to run on Windows, but it isn't needed to run Object
#   Spreadsheets.)
# - Put the submodule in a Meteor package and specify the desired files from
#   dist/ in package.js instead of checking in another copy.  Then Meteor builds
#   copy the entire submodule directory, which takes several minutes in Matt's
#   tests.
